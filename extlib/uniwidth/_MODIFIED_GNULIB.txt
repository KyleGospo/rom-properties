This copy of uniwidth is a modified subset of gnulib.

commit 2bbbc32f1527981473ed403d87c7f3ddbb906634
string-buffer: Enable resource leak warnings from clang.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Only the uniwidth subset is included.

- A CMake build system has been added.

- .in.h files have been changed to .h.

- CJK encoding checks have been removed, since we're only
  using UTF-8.
